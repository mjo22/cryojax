    """A lightweight wrapper around `equinox` for creating a "filter specification".

    A filter specification, or `filter_spec`, is a pytree whose
    leaves are either `True` or `False`. These are commonly used with
    `equinox` [filtering](https://docs.kidger.site/equinox/all-of-equinox/#2-filtering).

    In `cryojax`, it is a common pattern to need to finely specify which
    leaves we would like to take JAX transformations with respect to. This is done with a
    pointer to individual leaves, which is referred to as a `where` function. See
    [`here`](https://docs.kidger.site/equinox/examples/frozen_layer/#freezing-parameters)
    in the `equinox` documentation for an example.

    **Returns:**

    The filter specification. This is a pytree of the same structure as `pytree` with
    `True` where the `where` function points to, and `False` where it does not
    (or the opposite, if `inverse = True`).
