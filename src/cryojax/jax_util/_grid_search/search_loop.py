    """Run a grid search to minimize the function `fn`.

    !!! question "What is a `tree_grid`?"

        For the grid search, we represent the grid as an arbitrary
        pytree whose leaves are JAX arrays with a leading dimension.
        For a particular leaf, its leading dimension indexes a set
        grid points. The entire grid is then the cartesian product
        of the grid points of all of its leaves.

    !!! warning

        A `tree_grid` can only have leaves that are JAX arrays of
        grid points and `None`. It is difficult to precisely check this
        condition even with a run-time type checker, so breaking it may
        result in unhelpful errors.

    To learn more, see the `tree_grid` manipulation routines [`tree_grid_shape`][] and
    [`tree_grid_take`][].

    **Arguments:**

    - `fn`: The function we would like to minimize with grid search. This
            should be evaluated at arguments `fn(y, args)`, where `y` is a
            particular grid point of `tree_grid`. The value returned by `fn`
            must be compatible with the respective `method`.
    - `method`: An interface that specifies what we would like to do with
                each evaluation of `fn`.
    - `tree_grid`: The grid as a pytree. Importantly, its leaves can only be JAX
                   arrays with leading dimensions and `None`.
    - `args`: Arguments passed to `fn`, as `fn(y, args)`.
    - `is_leaf`: As [`jax.tree_util.tree_flatten`](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.tree_util.tree_flatten.html).
                 This specifies what is to be treated as a leaf in `tree_grid`.
    - `progress_bar`: Add a [`tqdm`](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) progress bar to the
                      search loop.
    - `total_progress_bar_updates`:
        An interval for the number of iterations at which toupdate the
        tqdm progress bar. By default, this is `20`. Ignored if `progress_bar = False`.

    **Returns:**

    Any pytree, as specified by the method `AbstractGridSearchMethod.postprocess`.
