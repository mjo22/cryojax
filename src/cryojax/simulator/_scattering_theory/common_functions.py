    phase shift distribution using the interaction
    constant. For example, the case of the projection approximation,
    compute the phase shift distribution.

    !!! info
        In the projection approximation in cryo-EM, the phase shifts in the
        exit plane are given by

        $$\\eta(x, y) = \\sigma \\int dz \\ V(x, y, z),$$

        where $\\sigma$ is typically referred to as the interaction
        constant. However, in `cryojax`, the potential is rescaled
        to units of inverse length squared as

        $$U(x, y, z) = \\frac{2 m e}{\\hbar^2} V(x, y, z).$$

        With this rescaling of the potential, the phase shifts are equal to

        $$\\eta(x, y) = \\frac{\\lambda}{4 \\pi} \\int dz \\ U(x, y, z).$$
